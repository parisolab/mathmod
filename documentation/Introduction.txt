Chapter 1. Introduction

	MathMod is a mathematical modelling software that generate 3D and 4D surfaces by using 
	mathematical equations such as parametric and implicit functions.
	You can plot different functions simultaneously and combine them to build new functions.
	You can also animate and morph your models by using the time parameter

	MathMod three different types of surfaces:
		Implicit surfaces, where the x, y and z coordinates are related by an expression (i.e:F(x,y,z)=0)
		3D Parametric surfaces, where the x, y and z components are specified as functions of two independent variables u and v.
		4D Parametric surfaces, where the x, y, z and w components are specified as functions of two independent variables u and v.
		

	MathMod also provides some visual features:
		You can study a model in detail by rotating it to any angle and zooming in. 
		MathMod enables you to switch the mesh and fill on or off, smooth surfaces and display normals.
		MathMod can also be used to generate animations that showcase how the model morphs as it is given new parameters to work with.
