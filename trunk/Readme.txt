Changelog for MathMod-7.0 (11/02/2018)
1) Add support for complex scripts involving more than 100 functions declarations (previous versions were practically limited to less than 12 functions declarations).
2) Add six new scripts to generate plain-weave and wireframe patterns over any parametric surface (added at the bottom of the parametric models list   (Sinus/Catenoid/Knots)_Plain_weave and wireframe_(sinus/shell/knots) ) .
3) Add new function CmpId(n) to return the index of the component under calculation (see "Wireframe_Shell" script).
4) Code cleaning and optimization.
